    <h2>Objects in javascript:</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of key-value pairs, where
        the keys are strings (or Symbols) and the values can be of any data type, including other objects. Objects in
        JavaScript can be thought of as containers that hold various properties and methods.</p>
    <h2>Internal Representation:</h2>
    <p>At its core, an object in JavaScript is implemented as a collection of properties. Each property consists of a
        name (also called a key) and a corresponding value. These properties can store various types of data, including
        primitive values (like numbers, strings, and booleans), other objects, or even functions. The internal
        representation of objects can be understood as a combination of two primary components:
    <ol>
        <li><b>Properties:</b> Properties in JavaScript objects are stored as key-value pairs. These properties can be
            accessed
            using the dot notation (objectName.propertyName) or bracket notation (objectName['propertyName']).</li>
        <li><b>Methods:</b> In JavaScript, functions that are stored as object properties are referred to as methods.
            Methods
            allow objects to have associated behavior. They can be called using the same dot notation used to access
            properties.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
