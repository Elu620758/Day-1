    <h1>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):</h1>
    <p>An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet
        Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing
        the location of the host in the network. There are two versions of IP addresses in use: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6
        (128-bit) due to the increasing number of devices connected to the internet.

        IP addresses are divided into two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The former identifies the
        network itself, while the latter identifies the specific device within that network. IP addresses can be either
        private (used within a local network) or public (used to identify devices on the global internet).
    </p>
    <h1>Port:</h1>
    <p>A port is a communication endpoint used for identifying specific processes or services within a computer network.
        Ports are essential for enabling multiple network applications to coexist on a single device. Ports are
        identified by numbers ranging from 0 to 65535, and they are categorized into three ranges</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Well-known ports (0-1023): Reserved for standard services, such as HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).</li>
        <li>Registered ports (1024-49151): Used for various applications and services that are not part of the standard
            set.</li>
        <li>Dynamic or private ports (49152-65535): Available for temporary use by applications and processes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Ports allow computers to distinguish between different services on the same device, ensuring that incoming data
        reaches the appropriate application.
    </p>
    <h1>HTTP Methods (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Methods):</h1>
    <p>
        HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs, are used in the context of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol to specify
        the desired action when interacting with a web server. These methods define how data should be handled by the
        server. Some common HTTP methods include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>GET: Retrieves data from the server.</li>
        <li>POST: Sends data to the server to be processed.</li>
        <li>PUT: Updates or creates a resource on the server.</li>
        <li>DELETE: Removes a resource from the server.</li>
        <li>PATCH: Partially updates a resource.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These methods determine the nature of the interaction between a client (typically a web browser) and a server,
        allowing for various types of data manipulation and retrieval.</p>
    <h1>MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):</h1>
    <p>A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication at the
        data link layer of a network segment. It is a hardware address that provides a way to identify devices on a
        local network. MAC addresses are typically 48 bits long (12 hexadecimal characters) and are assigned by the
        manufacturer of the network interface.

        MAC addresses are used in Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks to ensure that data packets are sent to the correct
        destination device. They help manage data transmission between devices within the same local network.

        In summary, understanding IP addresses, ports, HTTP methods, and MAC addresses is essential for comprehending
        how data is routed, communicated, and managed across networks, particularly in the context of the internet and
        web-based applications. These concepts play a vital role in modern networking and are foundational for anyone
        working in the field of information technology.
